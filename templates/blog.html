  <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Hi, I’m Afzal Khan—a B.Tech Computer Science student at Lovely Professional University, passionate about building impactful solutions and constantly exploring new technologies. This space is my digital corner, where I share my projects, experiences, and everything I’m learning along the way.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    My journey with code began in my early academic years, driven by curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems. Over time, that interest has grown into a deep passion—whether I’m crafting Android apps that promote social good, building insightful dashboards to visualize data, or designing interactive web experiences. While I enjoy working across the stack, I particularly thrive when blending backend logic with clean, functional frontends.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I’ve worked on diverse projects—from <strong>GiveBack</strong>, a donation tracking app for NGOs, to data-driven dashboards that highlight energy usage and road accident trends. Each project has taught me something valuable—not just about technology, but about people, problems, and the power of thoughtful design.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    More than just coding, I love understanding the why behind a project. What’s the story? What impact does it have? This mindset helps me build with intention, keeping users and purpose at the core. I'm also a keen learner who believes in growing through feedback, collaboration, and the occasional mistake.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    This site is where I document it all—from successes and lessons to things I’m building or experimenting with. It’s not just a portfolio—it’s a growing archive of my journey in tech.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    So if you’re into tech, data, apps, or just curious ideas, I hope you’ll join me. The journey is far from over, and I’d love to share it with you.
